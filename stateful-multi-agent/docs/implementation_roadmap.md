# ðŸ§© Implementation Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

1. **Domain Setup**
   - Value Objects
   - Aggregates per context
   - Domain events
2. **Repositories**
   - Interface definitions
   - Initial in-memory implementations
3. **Domain Services**
   - Cross-aggregate orchestration
   - Business rules spanning multiple aggregates
4. **Event Dispatcher / Bus**
   - Event emission from aggregates
   - Event subscribers for projections
5. **Read Models / Projections**
   - UI, analytics, AI agent projections
   - Event-driven updates
6. **Application Services**
   - Use case orchestration
   - Payment handling, access granting, refunds
7. **Domain Tests**
   - Aggregate invariants
   - Business behavior tests
   - Event emission validation
8. **Infrastructure & Integration**
   - Database persistence
   - Message bus implementation
   - External systems (payments, notifications)
9. **Iteration & Scaling**
   - Add additional aggregates
   - Add analytics or AI agent endpoints
   - Refine projections and event handling

## âœ… Essence

> By following this roadmap:
> - Aggregates own behavior and invariants
> - Repositories handle persistence only
> - Domain events manage cross-context communication
> - Application services orchestrate without embedding business rules
> - Projections provide read-optimized views
> - Domain tests guarantee correctness
>
> You maintain a **robust, scalable, and maintainable DDD system** ready for implementation, UI, and AI agent integration.
